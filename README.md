Mostly for myself to keep track of things

TODO:
- track thread IDs, capability counter, thread counter, across threads
- test branch function
- clarify new variable/ref semantics
- implement new object semantics
- capability checking for objects and functions
- what needs to be passed with values or used after evaluation (read type doc to make sure I understand fully)
