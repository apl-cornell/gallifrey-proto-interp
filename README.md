### Files:
- `main.ml` - the entry point to the project
- `ast.ml` - encodes the AST nodes
- `pprint.ml` - various functions for pretty-printing
- `utils.ml` - an assortment of utility functions that don't directly evaluate an AST node. handles things like checking capabilities and invariants, and also contains the definitions for states and capability sets and various operations on those data structures
- `eval.ml` - functions for evaluating AST nodes
- `parser.mly` and `lexer.mll` - the lexer and parser
- `test.ml` - automated test cases

### Makefile:
- `make` - build the interpreter
- `make bisect` - `make test` then `make report`
- `make test` - build the interpreter and run the tests in `test.ml`
- `make clean` - remove the files generated by previous compilations/executions
- `make report` - use a generate bisect/coverage file to generate an HTML report on code coverage

### Usage:
1. `make`
2. `./gallifrey <filename>` to run a core Gallifrey source file OR `./gallifrey -test` to run the test cases
